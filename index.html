        <h1>Tristan's Mii</h1>

        <h3>What is a Mii?</h3>
<p>Mii's are the avatars that you can create on Nintendo Consolesâ€”Wii series, DS series, and Switch series specifically!
These avatars are able to be used in games and they even have their very own. You have pretty much free will with what you want your Mii to look like.
Want it to look like you? Go for it! What about Garfield? That's cool! Or perhaps your single aunt that has an unhealthy obsession with birds? No one's stopping you!
Mii's can be such a fun way to express your creativity.
