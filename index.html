        <h1>Tristan's Mii</h1>

        <h3>What is a Mii?</h3>
<p>Mii's are the avatars that you can create on Nintendo Consoles—Wii series, DS series, and Switch series specifically!
These avatars are able to be used in games and they even have their very own. You have pretty much free will with what you want your Mii to look like.
Want it to look like you? Go for it! What about Garfield? That's cool! Or perhaps your single aunt that has an unhealthy obsession with birds? No one's stopping you!
Mii's can be such a fun way to express your creativity.
</p>

<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/tomodachi/images/9/92/Yellow.png">
<p>He sports mostly yellow clothing. Some of the gift items he has is a Nintendo 3DS XL, a treadmill, and a punching bag. He was the first Mii on the island and has seen it grow and shape into what it is today.</p>

        <h2>Miitopia</h2>
        <p>Miitopia is a role-playing game released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2016-2017, and rereleased for the Nintendo Switch in 2021. In this game, you lead a team of Miis to go on a journey to defeat the Dark Lord, an evil entity that steals faces of Miis in the world.</p>
<p>My Mii has the Flower job and has the kind personality. He's level 37 and his favorite food in this game is Dragon Fruit ★.
    His best friend is Chopsticks and his war cry is "aw yea, this is happening!" A war cry is what your Mii shouts when defeating an enemy or when viewing the Mii's profile. My Miis past jobs were the Pop Star and Chef jobs.
